## Project criteria
Create an app that retrieves some data from one of the cat API endpoints and renders it on a web page.

## Improvements

Given the time constraint I created a simple responsive single page app that fetches data from the cat api and displays the cat picture and the cat id below.

* Mordernise and improve styling
* Create an image carousel and populate it with images from fetching data from cat api
* Use react router and create another page for the image carousel
